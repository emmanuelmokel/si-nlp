This repository was created as a part of a research independent study for Emmanuel Mokel under Dr. Samuel Wiseman of the Computer Science Department at Duke University. Subspace Inference is a recently developed technique in which is introduced in the paper following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07504. We seek to utilize Bayesian Inference techniques to better characterize uncertainty and reduce variance in outputs of natural language processing tasks. The primary model being used for this project is DistilBERT, a transformer-based model released in 2019 https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108, and this is to be tested on several GLUE benchmarks https://gluebenchmark.com/ , which provides a suite of natural language understanding tasks for training, testing, and validation of models.
